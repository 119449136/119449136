<b>Dairygold Co-op Superstores – yard assistant/forklift operator              (October 2018- present)</b>
<br>
After I completed my leaving certificate in the summer of 2018, I was unsure what to study
<br>
 in college and decided to work full time for the year. I found employment at the Co-op Superstores
<br>
 in Mallow working

 as an employee in the yard. 

I now work there at weekends and during holidays.
<br>
<br>
 Duties included:
<br>
•	Providing information to customers about the products sold in the yard which expanded my product knowledge and improved my social skills.
<br>
•	Help load customer’s cars for them with heavy products such as coal and bags of feeding for animals.
<br>
•	Operating the forklift indoors and outdoors to move heavy pallets of coal, feeding and other heavy cargo which helped developed my awareness.
<br>
•	General cleaning of the warehouse and the yard and removing all waste material.
<br>

<b>Fitzgeralds Pub, Ballyclough - Bartender         (June 2018 to August-2018)</b>
<br>
After completing my leaving certificate, I occasionally assisted in my local pub that summer 
<br>
for a source of funds and work experience. Working in the pub helped me improve interacting with customers. 
<br>
<br>
My main duties involved:
<br>
•	Taking orders from the customers and serving them their drinks and food from behind the bar.
<br>
•	Cleaning the pub by mopping spillages on the floor, collecting empty glasses from tables and cleaning the bathrooms.
<br>
•	Restocking the fridges with bottles of drink and the shelves with food.
<br>
•	Switching the empty beer kegs in the back with full ones to operate the beer taps at the bar to serve drinks.

<br>
My first part time job I worked in a shop, bed and breakfast and butchers all under the same roof.
<br>
This employment benefited me greatly as it was my first experience working with customers, money etc.
  <br>
 <br>
 My main duties whilst working here included:
<br>
•	Serving customers at the till, taking their money and giving them back the correct change.
<br>
•	In the butchers I cut the meat using the different knives and saws, weighed and calculated meat prices and prepared orders such as turkeys for the customers.
<br>
•	In the bed and breakfast, I greeted incoming guests at the front door, showed them to their rooms and brought up their luggage for them. I also took orders and served customers their breakfast in the mornings.
<br>
•	I also did house cleaning in the bed and breakfast by hoovering the bedrooms, changing the bedsheets and cleaned the bathrooms after the guests left their rooms.
